\begin{rSection}{Experience}

\begin{rSubsection}{Yandex.Weather}{September 2017 - present time}{Python Developer}{}
\item At Yandex.Weather I'm using \textit{machine learning} methods to make weather forecasts. There are large datasets from forecast providers for analysis and processing, so I need to use various \textit{big data} technics such as MapReduce paradigm. The purpose of my work is to improve the quality of daily weather forecast, calculated by technology named Meteum. I also support and develop code that regularly calculates weather forecasts around the world.

\end{rSubsection}


\begin{rSubsection}{Stepik}{June 2015 - September 2017}{Python Developer}{}
\item At Stepik I was involved in various data analysis tasks, mostly related to \textit{content recommendations}. During the first months of work I designed and implemented a simple \textit{rule-based} recommender system for educational content. Later I worked on an \textit{adaptive} recommender system, that uses knowledge graph and psychometric models for the most efficient learning. Also during my time at Stepik I completed many separate backend tasks using Django framework, including but not limited to implementation of data analysis algorithms described above.
\end{rSubsection}


%\begin{rSubsection}{}{2012 - present time}{Math Tutor}{}
%\item Since school graduating I'm teaching general and olympiad maths, which improves my communication scills and also helps me to explain complex subjects more clearly.
%\end{rSubsection}

%\begin{rSubsection}{Lanit-Tercom, Inc.}{\em Sep 2013 - May 2014}{student project}{}
%\item During the academic year I participated in a student project, aimed at running a quadrocopter. Our task was to keep it in the air and process data from its sensors. 
%\item  At first I was involved in transfering videos from the camera to the client browser, and later I worked on the calibration of the sensors. During this project I improved my teamwork skills and got some practical experience working on a real case.
